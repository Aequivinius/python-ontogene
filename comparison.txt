* start & end positions differ slightly
	* my end position is always 1 less (except for the first one, which is one more?)
		* so they are consistent in my file, with what I get returned from get_whole_abstract_minus_mesh()
		* this might be a python thing, with my end position i can do text[start:end], whereas text[end-1] is the last character of the string found
		> this I ask Fabio what he wants, for now I keep it my way because it seems more pythonic

	* and except for the first entry my start position is always 2 less

		* this is possibly to do with how he joins the fragments title and abstract, maybe there’s a \n character in his version or so
		> let’s check if there’s an output file where I can see this. so, there is the id.xml, in which there is <article-title>, <abstract> etc.
		> I probs should do that, too, huh?
>>> oki, but here we left off.




* for bradycardia I return two entries when Fabio’s only returns 1, because there’s several entries with different internal IDs in my termlist
* Fabio uses a different ID, namely D003000 for clonidine, and D001919 for bradycardia (when I use 1SU and 15I / 15J, respectively).
	* This is probably the ID from the original DB, as opposed to the internal one; so I should change this
* oki, and then Fabio has the origin within text (article-title, abstract in this case). This might also be the source of the error of the offsets; but could be really hard to get
* sentence i can add easily
* the last one all is mesh_desc, check mail what this means exactly
