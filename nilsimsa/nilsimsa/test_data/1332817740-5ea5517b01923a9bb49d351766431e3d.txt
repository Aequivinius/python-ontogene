	   Devils Lake and Grafton are among 12 North Dakota cities that will host community meetings focusing on building rural North Dakota. Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Agricultureâs Rural Development, the tour is designed to build on the ND 2.0 Summit in October in Bismarck.  
âEngaging and listening to communities is pivotal to building a better North Dakota,â said Rural Developmentâs State Director Jasper Schneider.
