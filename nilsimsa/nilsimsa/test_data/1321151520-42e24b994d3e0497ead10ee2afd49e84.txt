Pletcher removed the blinkers for the Carl G. Rose Classic, which was run at 1 1/8 miles.     
   Turbo Compressor set fractions of :24 for the opening quarter-mile, :48.64 for a half-mile, 1:12.64 for six furlongs, and 1:38.46 for a mile while nursing a one- to two-length lead. He pulled away in the stretch to win by 10 1/2 lengths in 1:51.42 on a fast track.     
   Turbo Compressor paid $8.40 to win as the third choice.                                                                                                                                                                                               Manicero           , the second choice, sat in third for the most of the way before overtaking favored                                Mad Hatter        for second. Mad Hatter was clearly third best after stalking the leader through the first mile of the race.     
   Ginny Di Pasquale, an assistant to Pletcher, said Turbo Compressor didn’t care for racing in blinkers last time, so the equipment was removed.     
   “This race was a natural for him with the distance and the fact he’s a Florida-bred,” DiPasquale said. “He has won races before going wire-to-wire like he did today.”     
   “He broke perfectly and I put him out to an easy lead,” Saez said. “When I asked him he responded and drew off. This is my first ride for Todd Pletcher. I’m glad he won, and I hope I can ride for him again.”     
   Turbo Compressor is now four-for-nine with a second and a third.
