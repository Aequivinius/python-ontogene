      Get thinner and healthier — faster and more affordably        
       
 
                                        
       I f you are obese, you are not alone. More than one third of American adults (more than 72 million people), and 17 percent of children aged 2 to 19 years are affected. Since 1990, obesity rates for adults have doubled and rates for children have tripled. Obesity impacts all ages, genders, races, ethnicities, socioeconomic groups, education levels, and parts of the world.    
   Eating too much of the wrong foods over a period of time often results in a big waist — and a big waste.The costs of obesity are high — individually and for society. It can cost a person the ability to move well and live independently. Obesity related disorders include diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, depression, and certain cancers.The treatment of these conditions can deplete a person’s savings, take years off of their life, and increase the costs in our healthcare system.    
   For the past two years, Dr. Ken Freedman, a chiropractor and wellness specialist, has been helping hundreds of people lose weight fast, while becoming healthier in the process. It’s called the Doctor Supervised ChiroThin Weight Loss Program, which he offers in his East Brunswick office. “When I first heard about the program, I thought it was too good to be true,” said Dr. Freedman. Over the six weeks of the ChiroThin program, a person eats real food they buy from the grocery store. There are no exercises, drugs, hormones, prepackaged foods, shakes or bars.“During the eight years I was disabled from a severely arthritic knee, I was inactive and gained 40 pounds. I was unhappy with the way I looked. My body hurt. I felt compelled to do something and didn’t want to take drugs. I found the ChiroThin and was the first in this area to do it. My results were dramatic. In six weeks I lost 30 pounds and felt the best I had in years. My patients and friends saw my transformation. They were so impressed with my results they decided to try it themselves. They have also been thrilled with their experience and their fantastic results.”    
                         
                                                       
   
       
      
   The Doctor Supervised ChiroThin Weight Loss Program is designed by doctors and supervised by Dr. Freedman. It combines a very low calorie, low glycemic index diet with nutritional support and private, weekly doctor supervision to help you improve your health and lose weight without starvation.The meals you make in the ChiroThin program are delicious, easy to prepare, and can also be enjoyed by the client’s entire family. Enjoy dining out? Dr. Freedman has joined with local restaurants to create a ChiroThin menu unique to each participating eatery. Clients have the convenience of eating satisfying meals out within the program’s guidelines, without a fuss. EB Chinese was the first to come aboard and is currently developing their fourth version; the Colonial Diner, Stephano’s Restaurant and Pizzeria, and the Spotswood Diner offer their own versions. More restaurants will be joining them.    
   The ChiroThin program is safe and effective for nearly all adults and children, including diabetics, people with high blood pressure, and people on medication( s). Dr. Freedman indicated that while individual results vary, in 42 days many of his female clients lose between two to three dress sizes and more than 20 pounds; male clients lose 25-35 pounds. In addition, his clients receive information and easy-to-follow strategies needed for long-term weight management. Many clients who suffered with long-standing conditions such as high blood pressure, arthritis, joint pain, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia also saw improvement in these conditions during the six-week program.    
   “While the ChiroThin program is not a treatment for medical conditions,” Dr. Freedman explained,“conditions that are influenced by excess weight or inflammatory foods respond better when the body has reduced excess weight and the person eats meals that don’t contain inflammatory foods. It’s a common-sense approach that people can live with — literally!”     
   The Doctor Supervised ChiroThin Weight Loss Program enables a person to lose weight faster, healthier and save money.The cost is a fraction of many other nationally advertised programs, which take twice as long or longer to lose the same amount of weight. Many ChiroThin clients also save $200-$400 on food costs during the six-week period.“I believe the ChiroThin program is the best for a variety of reasons,” said Dr. Freedman. “It offers a higher level of support and expertise, it jumpstarts a person toward better habits of eating and teaches them how to eat healthier for life, and it enables a person to break free from the toxic foods that promote inflammation and many debilitating conditions.The most gratifying part of the ChiroThin program is sharing my clients’ joy as they look better and feel great!”
