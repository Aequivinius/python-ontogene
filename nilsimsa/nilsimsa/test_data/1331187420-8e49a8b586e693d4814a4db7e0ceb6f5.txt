   Good morning everyone, we have a lot planned on Today in Alabama.     
   Tonight is the first Decision 2012 debate between President Barack Obama and GOP contender Mitt Romney.   You can catch it live on WSFA 12 News starting at 8 p.m.    We'll have more on how both candidates have been preparing.     
   It's almost time to lace up the running shoes in Montgomery.   This year's Montgomery half marathon is this Saturday.  You have until Friday a noon to register for the 13.1 mile run and the 5K.  The half marathon is $75 and the 5K is $35.   The runners will start at 7 a.m. Saturday morning and finish up at Riverwalk Stadium.   Our Melissa Johnson will have a live report to get you ready for the big race.     
   The search for two escaped inmates is now over.   Jamie Morgan and Jeremy Hadden escaped from the Elmore County Jail back on September 18     th      .   They were found yesterday in a hotel room in Pensacola, Florida.  They were originally in jail on theft charges, they're now facing escape charges too.  The Elmore County Sheriff says they should be back in Alabama in a few days.     
   These are just some of the stories we're working on.  Josh will let us know if we'll make it into the 70's today.  Join us at 5 a.m. for Today in Alabama.
